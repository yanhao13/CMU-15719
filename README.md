### Clearing the clouds away from the true potential and obstacles posed by this computing capability.
### Oracle's CEO Larry Ellison vent his frustration: "The interesting thing about cloud computing is that we've redefined cloud computing to include exerything that we already do.... I don't understand what we would do differently in the light of cloud computing other than change the wording of some of our ads."
cloud computing, the long-held dream of computing as a utility, has the potential to transform a large part of it industry, making sw even more attractive aaS and shaping the way it hw is designed and purchased; 
developers with innovative ideas for new internet services no longer require the large capital outlays in hw to deploy their service or the human expense to operate it, they need not be concerned about overprovisioning for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, hus wasting costly resources, or underprovisioning for one that becomes wildly popular, thus missing potential customers and revenue; 
moreover, companies with large batch-oriented tasks can get results as quickly as their programs can scale, since using 1000 servers for 1hr costs no more than using 1 server for 1000hrs, this elasticity of resources, without paying a premium for large scale, is unprecedented in history of it.
### Defining Cloud Computing
cloud computing refers to both the applications delivered aaS over the internet and the hw and systems sw in the data centers that provide those services, the services themselves have long been referred to as SaaS(*here we use the term SaaS to mean applications delivered over the internet, the broadest definition would encompass any on demand sw, including those that run sw locally but control use via remote sw licensing), some vendors use terms such as IaaS, PaaS to describe their products, but we eschew these because accepted definitions for them still vary widely, the line bt low-level infra and a higher-level platform is not crisp, we believe the two are more alike than different, and we consider them together; similarly, the related term grid computing, from the hp computing community, suggests protocols to offer shared computation and storage over long distances, but those protocols did not lead to a sw environment that grew beyond its community; 
the data center hw and sw is what we will call a **cloud**, when a cloud is made available in a pay-as-you-go manner to the general public, we call it a **public cloud**, the service being sold is **utility computing**, we use the term **private cloud** to refer to internal data centers of a business or other org, not made available to the general public, when they are large enough to benefit from the advantages of cloud computing that we discuss here; thus cloud computing is sum of SaaS and utility computing, but does not include small or medium sized data centers, even if these rely on virtualization for mgmt, people can be users or providers of SaaS, or users or providers of utility computing; we focus on SaaS providers(cloud users) and cloud providers, which have received less attention than SaaS users, [click for making provider-user relationships clear](./img/making-provider-user-relationships-clear.png), in some cases, the same actor can play multiple roles, for example, a cloud provider might also host its own customer-facing services on cloud infra; 
from a hw provisioning and pricing point of view, 3 aspects are new in cloud computing including: the appearance of infinite computing resources available on demand, quickly enough to follow load surges, thereby eliminating need for cloud computing users to plan far ahead for provisioning; elimination of an up-front commitment by cloud users, thereby allowing companies to start small and increase hw resources only when there is an increase in their needs(*note, however, that upfront commitments can still be used to reduce per-usage charges, for exmaple, AWS also offers long-term rental of servers, which they call reserved instances); the ability to pay for use of computing resources on a short-term basis as needed(such as processors by the hr and storage by the day) and release them as needed, thereby rewarding conservation by letting machines and storage go when they are no longer useful; 
we argue that construction and operation of extremely large scale, commodity-computer data centers at low cost locations was the key necessary enabler of cloud computing, for they uncovered factors of 5`7 decrease in cost of electricity, network bdwidth, ops, sw, and hw available at these very large economies of scale; these factors, combined with statistical multiplexing to increase utilization compared to traditional data centers, meant that cloud computing could offer services below the costs of a medium sized data center and yet still make a good profit; 
out proposed definition allows us to clearly identify certain installations as examples and non-examples of cloud computing, consider a public-facing internet service hosted on an ISP who can allocate more machines to the service given 4hrs notice, since load surges on the public internet can happen much more quickly than that(we saw its load to double every 12 hrs for nearly 3 days), this is not cloud computing, in contrast, consider an internal enterprise data center whose applications are modified only with significant advance notice to administrators, in this scenario large load surges on the scale of mins are highly unlikely, so as long as allocation can track expected load increases, this scenario fulfills one of the necessary conditions for operating as a cloud, the enterprise data center may still fail to meet other conditions for being a cloud, however, such as the appearance of infinite resources for fine-grained billing; a private data center may also not benefit from economies of scale that make public clouds financially attractive; 
omitting private clouds from cloud computing has led to considerable debate in the blogosphere, we believe the confusion and skepticism illustrated by Larry Ellison's quote occurs when advantages of public clouds are also claimed for medium sized data centers, except for extremely large data centers of hundreds of thousands of machines, such as those that might be operated by Google, Microsoft, [most data centers enjoy only a subset of the potential advantages of public clouds, click to view](./img/most-data-centers-enjoy-only-a-subset-of-the-potential-advantages-of-public-clouds.png), hence we believe that including traditional data centers in the definition of cloud computing will lead to exaggerated claims for smaller so-called private clouds, which is why we exclude them, however, here we describe how so-called private clouds can get more of the benefits of public clouds through surge computing, hybrid cloud computing.
### Classes of Utility Computing
any application needs a model of computation, a model of storage, and a model of comm, the statistical multiplexing necessary to achieve elasticity and the appearance of infinite capacity available on demand requires automatic allocation and mgmt, in practice, this is done with virtualization of some sort, we argue that different utility computing offerings will be distinguished based on the cloud sytem sw's level of abstraction and on the level of mgmt of resources;
Amazon EC2 is at one end of the spectrum, an EC2 instance looks much like physical hw, and users can control nearly the entire sw stack, from the kernel upward, this low level makes it inherently difficult for Amazon to offer automatic scalability and failover because the semantics associated with replication and other state mgmt issues are highly application-dependent; at the other extreme of the spectrum are application domain-specific platforms such as Google AppEngine, which is targeted exclusively at traditional web applications, enforcing an application structure of clean separation bt a stateless computation tier and a stateful storage tier, AppEngine's impressive automatic scaling and high-availability mechanisms, and the proprietary MegaStore data storage available to AppEngine applications, all rely on these constraints; applications for Microsoft's Azure are written using .NET libs, and compiled to the Common Language Runtime, a lang-independent managed environment, the framework is significantly more flexible than AppEngine's, but still constrains user's choice of storage model and application structure, hence Azure is intermediate bt hw vms like EC2 and application frameworks like AppEngine.
### Cloud Computing Economics
we see 3 particularly compelling use cases that favor utility computing over conventional hosting, including: (i)when demand for a service varies with time, for example, provisioning a data center for the peak load it must sustain a few days per month leads to underutilization at other times, instead, cloud computing lets an org pay by hr of computing resources, potentially leading to cost savings even if the hourly rate to rent a machine from a cloud provider is higher than the rate to own one; (ii)when demand is unknown in advance, for example, a web startup will need to support a spike in demand when it becomes popular, followed potentially by a reduction once some visitors turn away; (iii)orgs that perform batch analytics can use the cost associativity of cloud computing to finish computations faster :using 1000 EC2 machines for 1hr costs the same as using 1 machine for 1000hrs; 
although the economic appeal of cloud computing is often described as CapEx2OpEx -converting capital expenses to operating expenses, we believe the phrase pay-as-you-go more directly captures the economic benefit to the buyer, hrs purchased via cloud computing can be distributed non-uniformly in time(for example, use 100 server hrs today and no server hrs tomorrow, and still pay only for 100), in the networking community, this way of selling bdwidth is already known as usage-based pricing(*usage-based pricing is not renting, renting a resources involves paying a negotiated cost to have the resource over some time period, whether or not you use the resource, vs., pay-as-you-go involves metering usage and charging based on actual use, independently of the time period over which the usage occurs); in addition, absence of upfront capital expense allows capital to be rediected to core business investment; 
hence, even if Amazon's pay-as-you-go pricing was more expensive than buying and depreciating a comparable server over the same period, we argue that the cost is outwrighed by the extremely important cloud computing economic benefits of elasticity and transference of risk, esp. risks of overprovisioning(underutilization) and underprovisioning(saturation).
